		<p>I am currently working on on <b>MetRS</b> which is the enzyme that is responsible for attaching the <i>Methionine</i> to its cognate tRNA. This enzyme belog to a the tRNA-Synthetases (also been called tRNA-Ligase). Study on these enzymes can be important due to the evolutionary studies and also drug dicovery purposes. These enzymes catch the amino acid and ATP in their active site and then the tRNA, then with some conformational change they will attach the amino acid to the correct tRNA. </p>
		<p>This the link for my profile in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Behrooz_Ghazi_Esfahani">Research-Gate</a>. I took my bachelor's degree in <i>Cellular Biology</i> from <b>University of Kurdistan</b> and my Master's in <i>Microbial Biotechnology</i> from <b>Univerisy of Tehran</b>. <p>

This is a sideview of the 
<i>Clathrin</i> map(3D structure
 which I obtained from the 
particles those I picked
 manually from Cryo-EM
 micrographs myself in 
my 2nd rotation at Dr. Stagg's
lab.you can find more about
this research at this <a href="http://biophysics.fsu.edu/sstagg/research/">link</a>
